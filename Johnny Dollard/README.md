# Game 1
This game is currently unnamed.
It is a game where your guy goes around doing stuff.
Here is what is done in the game:

Movement, dying, coin pickups, chests, fightig, killing and get killed by enemy1, killing enemy2 using enemy1, getting damaged by enemy2, upgrading speed and health regen, Game-Over animation, and a score(not saved).

Here is what I want to add in the near future: 

Instruction screen, implementation of zombie either as separate enemy or ill effects of a current enemy, highscore saving, and pause button.
